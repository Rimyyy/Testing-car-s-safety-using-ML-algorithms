# Decision Tree Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn


In this project, I build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the safety of the car. I build two models, one with criterion `gini index` and another one with criterion `entropy`. I implement Decision Tree Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn. I have used the **Car Evaluation Data Set** for this project
